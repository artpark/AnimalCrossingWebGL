Animal Crossing was released in 2001 and was developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube. Later, its sequel, Animal Crossing: Wild World, was released for the Nintendo DS. Its latest installment, Animal Crossing: New Leaf, was released in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS.
	
You play as the mayor of a new town in need of guidance. The player is tasked with activities such fishing, bug-catching, and even fossil hunting. Through the playerâ€™s dedication, the town thrives with the construction of new buildings and structures.

Our recreation, Animal Crossing: World Wild Web, will feature a town filled with many villagers, houses and trees. The player controls the mayor and can walk around through town, speaking with many of the villagers. 

Many other features we want to add include chopping down trees, digging up fossils, giving villager items, and many more.
